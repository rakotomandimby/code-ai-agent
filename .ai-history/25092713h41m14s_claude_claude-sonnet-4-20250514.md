# Have an express server running in `./code-ai-agent/googleai-agent/src/main.ts`

I want an express server to run on port 5000 and have a single endpoint `/` that returns a JSON response with a message "GoogleAI Agent is running".
Tell me the "npm install" command to issue and the full new content of the files I need to modify in order to have that.




# ANT Implement GoogleAI Agent Express Server on Port 5000

I need to modify the existing Google AI agent to run on port 5000 and return a specific JSON response. The current main.ts file already has the basic Express server setup, but I need to update the default port and response message.

No additional npm packages are needed since Express is already installed in the root package.json dependencies.

## Files to modify:

### ./code-ai-agent/googleai-agent/src/main.ts

```typescript
import express from 'express';

const host = process.env.HOST ?? 'localhost';
const port = process.env.PORT ? Number(process.env.PORT) : 5000;

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'GoogleAI Agent is running' });
});

app.listen(port, host, () => {
  console.log(`[ ready ] http://${host}:${port}`);
});
```

## Changes made:

1. Changed the default port from 3000 to 5000 to match the requirement
2. Updated the response from `res.send({ message: 'Hello API' })` to `res.json({ message: 'GoogleAI Agent is running' })` to return the specific message requested
3. Used `res.json()` instead of `res.send()` for proper JSON response formatting

## No npm install needed:

The Express dependency is already available in the root package.json, so no additional installation is required.

You can run the server using:
```bash
npx nx serve googleai-agent
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:5000/` and return the JSON response `{"message": "GoogleAI Agent is running"}`.

# Have an express server running in `./code-ai-agent/googleai-agent/src/main.ts`

I want an express server to run on port 5000 and have a single endpoint `/` that returns a JSON response with a message "GoogleAI Agent is running".
Tell me the "npm install" command to issue and the full new content of the files I need to modify in order to have that.




# OPN Implement an Express server for the GoogleAI agent that runs on port 5000 and serves "/" with a JSON message

I implement an Express server in googleai-agent/src/main.ts that listens on port 5000 by default and exposes a single GET endpoint at "/" returning a JSON response with the message "GoogleAI Agent is running". I also provide the npm install command to ensure dependencies are installed.

npm install command to run from the repository root:
- cd code-ai-agent && npm install

Files modified:
- googleai-agent/src/main.ts

Full updated file contents:

- code-ai-agent/googleai-agent/src/main.ts
```
import express from 'express';

const host = process.env.HOST ?? 'localhost';
const port = process.env.PORT ? Number(process.env.PORT) : 5000;

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'GoogleAI Agent is running' });
});

app.listen(port, host, () => {
  console.log(`[ ready ] http://${host}:${port}`);
});
```

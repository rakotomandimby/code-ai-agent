# Improve `./code-ai-agent/googleai-agent/src/main.ts` to create and insert data in SQLite database

I want to enhance the existing Express server in `./code-ai-agent/googleai-agent/src/main.ts`.
I want that when the server receives a POST request on the `/` path and the body has a "type" field with value "api key",
then the server creates a new SQLite database (if it does not exist), 
create a "config" table with 3 columns (id, key, value),
then insert the recors ("api_key", <value of "text" field in the request body>) in that table,

Tell me the "npm install" command to issue and the full new content of the files I need to modify in order to have that.

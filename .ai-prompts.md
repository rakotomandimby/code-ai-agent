# Check overall uniformity in the code 

I noticed, for exemple, that in the OpenAI `main.ts` file, I have:

```ts
type DataEntry = { file_path: string; file_content: string };
type ConversationMessage = { role: 'user' | 'assistant'; content: string };
```

I am not sure the other agents code has the same data structure.
I want to make the look of the code uniform across the different agents,
so that we can easily see that it has been developed by one person that has the same style.

We will level it by taking what is good, and applying it to all the agents code.
Do not leave unused code, remove it.

Tell me the full new content of the files that need to be changed to make the code uniform across the different agents.

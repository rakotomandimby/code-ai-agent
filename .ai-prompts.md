# Write the Anthropic Claude agent by mimicking the GoogleAI Gemini agent code, but adapting it to the Anthropic API specifications.

I write the Google AI Gemini agent in `./code-ai-agent/googleai-agent/` directory.
It is working fine.

I want you to write the Anthropic Claude agent in `./code-ai-agent/anthropic-agent/` directory.

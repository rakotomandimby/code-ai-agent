# Fix the "PayloadTooLargeError" error when body is large

When POSTing large payloads to the agents, I get the following error:

```
Error processing request: PayloadTooLargeError: request entity too large
```

I get this on all 3 agents.

Analyze the code and propose a fix for this issue.
It might just be a setting that needs to be changed in a variable or configuration file.
Tell me the **full new content** of the files I need to change to fix this issue.

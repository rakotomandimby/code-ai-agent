# Inform about processing 

I want each agent to print several things when it processes a user request:

- Print ">>>> Request received on {AGENT_NAME}" when it receives the "api key" data
- Print ">>>> Waiting a bit before sending the request to the {AGENT_NAME} - {AI_MODEL}" just before the 3 seconds wait
- Print ">>>> Sending request to {AGENT_NAME} - {AI_MODEL}" just before sending the request to the AI model
- Print "<<<< Response received from {AGENT_NAME} - {AI_MODEL}" (took {TIME_TAKEN}s)" when it receives the response from the AI_MODEL

Where {AGENT_NAME} is the name of the agent (GoogleAI, OpenAI, Anthropic), {AI_MODEL} is the model being used (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, claude-2, etc.),
and {TIME_TAKEN} is the time between sending the request to the AI model API and receiving the response.

I made the changes for Anthropic agent, OpenAI agent, but I need you to give me the content for the GoogleAI agent.
Tell me the full content of the files I need to change in order to implement this logging functionality.

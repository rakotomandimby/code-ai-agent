# Convert OpenAI request body to multi-turn chat format

Current resquest body sent to OpenAI API is not multi-turn chat.
But request body sent to Anthropics and GoogleAI are multi-turn chat.

I want to convert the request body sent to OpenAI API to multi-turn chat.

Tell me the full new content of the files I need to modify in order to achieve sending multi-turn chat request body to OpenAI API.

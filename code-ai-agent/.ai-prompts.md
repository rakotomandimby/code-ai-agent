# Handle Anthropic Error

When the Anthropic API answers with other than an HTTP 200 status code, the response has this structure:

```json
{"type":"error","error":{"type":"overloaded_error","message":"Overloaded"}}
```

I want to gracefully handle specific API errors from Anthropic by catching them in the `AIHttpClient`, 
extracting the error message, and formatting it into a standard Anthropic response structure before returning it, 
I prefer that instead of letting the raw error propagate.

Tell me the modifications to make to the code in order to achieve that.
In the same way I managed `getGeminiErrorResponse`, prefer to use a separate file in order to get reasonable lines of code in the `AIHttpClient` class.

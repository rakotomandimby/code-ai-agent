# Launch without Internet

I launch this monorepo at boot with the script `./code-ai-agent-monorepo`.
The problem is that when Internet is not up yet, it fails with the error:

```
No existing Nx Cloud client and failed to download new version
```

IS there a way to launch the monorepo without Internet?

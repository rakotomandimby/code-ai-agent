# If the model to use is the string "disabled", just return a JSON response saying that the model is disabled

For each of the models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini), if the model to be used is the string "disabled", 
I want to return a JSON response saying that the model is disabled.
The returned JSON must match the response format of the model.

Tell me the modifications I have to make in the code to achieve this.

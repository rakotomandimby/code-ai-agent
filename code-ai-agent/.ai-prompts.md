# Display the API keys in the logs and refuse to start the server if they are not set 

This application will consume APIs.
That need API keys be at least set.

If API keys are not set, I want the server to refuse to start and display the API keys in the console logs.

Tell me the modifications to make to the code below to achieve that.

# Do this application starts if the environment variables for the LLM API keys are not set? 

Currently, I provide the API keys for the LLMs via environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API authentication
- `GOOGLEAI_API_KEY` - Google AI API authentication  
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Anthropic API authentication

But what is supposed to happen if these environment variables are not set?
Does the application start, or does it throw an error and refuse to start?

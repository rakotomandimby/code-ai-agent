# Do this application starts if the environment variables for the LLM API keys are not set? 

Currently, I provide the API keys for the LLMs via environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API authentication
- `GOOGLEAI_API_KEY` - Google AI API authentication  
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Anthropic API authentication

But what is supposed to happen if these environment variables are not set?
Does the application start, or does it throw an error and refuse to start?



# OPN Explanation of application behavior when LLM API key environment variables are not set

The application design uses environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLEAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) to provide API keys to each respective agent service. However, based on the provided code and architecture, the application does **not** throw an error or refuse to start if these environment variables are missing.

### Reasoning:

- The agent services (`openai-agent`, `googleai-agent`, `anthropic-agent`) start an Express server and use the shared router from `lib` which expects the API key to be passed in the request body under the `api_key` field.
- The `AIHttpClient` class (in `lib/src/ai-http-client.ts`) checks for the presence of the API key **at request time** (in the `post()` method). If the API key is missing, it returns a provider-specific error response object indicating the missing API key.
- The API key is **not** read directly from environment variables inside the `AIHttpClient` or the agent services. Instead, the API key must be passed in the request body (`api_key` field) for each request.
- The environment variables are typically loaded by the agent services via `dotenv.config()` in their `main.ts` files, but the code does not automatically inject these keys into the HTTP client or repository.
- Therefore, the application **starts normally** even if the environment variables are not set.
- When a client sends a request without an `api_key` in the body, the agent responds with a formatted error message indicating the missing API key.
- This design allows the application to run and handle requests gracefully, returning errors for missing API keys rather than crashing or refusing to start.

### Summary:

- **Application startup:** Does **not** fail if environment variables are missing.
- **Request handling:** If no API key is provided in the request body, the agent returns a provider-specific error response indicating the missing API key.
- **API key usage:** API keys must be passed in the request body (`api_key` field) for each request; environment variables are not automatically injected.

If you want the application to automatically read the API keys from environment variables and inject them into the HTTP client so that clients do not need to provide them in each request, you would need to implement that feature explicitly in the agent services or the shared library.

Let me know if you want me to help implement automatic environment variable API key injection or any other related feature.

# When loggin to the console, on the response loggin, show hoe much it took to generate the response

The current code logs that the model has been queried, then that the model has responded, but it does not tell how long it took to get the response.
I want that metric to be logged as well.

Tell me the modifications I need to make to the code to log the time it took to get the response from the model.

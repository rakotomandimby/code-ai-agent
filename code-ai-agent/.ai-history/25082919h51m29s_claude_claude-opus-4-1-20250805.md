# Make the LLM API keys to be obtained fron the clients. 

Currently, I must set the LLM API keys as environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API authentication
- `GOOGLEAI_API_KEY` - Google AI API authentication  
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Anthropic API authentication

I dont like that. I want the clients to provide the API keys in the requests.

I still hesitate on how to do that, because the priority is to have the same architecture as the existing.
So, my first idea is to add a new table to the existing database schema, called `api_key` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE api_key (
    id INTEGER,
    value TEXT
)
```

What is your opinion on that? Do not provide any code yet, just your opinion.
If your opinion differs from mine, explain it.


# ANT Evaluating API Key Storage Strategy for Multi-Provider AI Agent System

I understand you want to move from environment-based API keys to client-provided keys while maintaining the existing architecture. Your proposal to add an `api_key` table to the SQLite database is architecturally consistent with how the system currently handles other request parameters (model, temperature, top_p, etc.).

## Your Approach - Pros and Cons

**Pros of the database approach:**
- **Architectural consistency** - It perfectly aligns with the existing pattern where all request parameters are stored in SQLite tables before processing
- **Minimal code changes** - The `BaseRepository` already has the pattern for handling such data (getSetting method)
- **Request isolation** - Each request gets its own database instance in `/tmp/`, ensuring API keys don't leak between requests
- **Existing workflow compatibility** - The 1-second delay mechanism and chunk-based storage system remain unchanged

**Cons to consider:**
- **Security implications** - API keys would be written to disk (even temporarily), which could be a security concern in some environments
- **Cleanup dependency** - Relies on the existing `clear()` method being called after each request to remove sensitive data
- **Potential disk I/O overhead** - Though minimal since it's in `/tmp/` which is often a tmpfs mount

## Alternative Considerations

While your approach is solid, here are two alternatives to consider:

1. **In-memory storage in the repository class** - Store the API key as a class property in BaseRepository, passed through the router. This avoids disk writes but requires more refactoring.

2. **Header-based approach** - Pass API keys via custom headers (e.g., `X-Agent-API-Key`) and handle them directly in the HTTP client. This is more RESTful but deviates from your chunk-based architecture.

## My Recommendation

I actually **support your database approach** because:

1. It maintains the elegant uniformity of your system where ALL request configuration goes through the same SQLite/Chunk pattern
2. The temporary nature of the databases (created per request, cleared after response) minimizes security risks
3. It requires minimal changes to the existing codebase - just adding a new table and a `getApiKey()` method
4. It preserves the stateless nature of your services since each request creates its own isolated database

The only enhancement I'd suggest is ensuring the API key is **never logged** in any debug output and perhaps adding a comment in the code highlighting that this table contains sensitive data.

Your instinct to maintain architectural consistency is spot-on for long-term maintainability.
